# LC709204F
OnSemi low-power LiPo battery fuel gauge

Arduino test sketch for the [BMA400](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/product_flyer/bst-bma400-fl000.pdf) acclerometer and [LC709204F](https://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/LC709204F-D.pdf) LiPo battery fuel gauge demonstrating wake-on-motion, sleep-on-no-motion, alarm-on-low-battery-voltage, and alarm-on-high-temperature behavior. These are low power devices (800 nA BMA400 in low power mode running at 25 Hz, 2 uA for LC709204F in operate mode) perfect for ultra-low-power, battery-operated wearables and IoT applications.
